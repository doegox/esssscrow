Tools and procedures for facilitating a key escrow mechanism based on Shamir's Secret-Sharing Scheme where escrow authority is distributed amongst a business continuity team of which a defined number of members is required to recover escrowed data.

This project is the counterpart of an article published in [Misc magazine](http://www.ed-diamond.com/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=8) and now [available online](http://connect.ed-diamond.com/MISC/MISCHS-006/Sequestre-de-cles-mise-en-pratique-du-Shamir-s-Secret-Sharing-Scheme) under CC-BY-NC-ND.

For now it's just a bunch of bash scripts to be run from a LiveCD.

The LiveCD is to be created with [Debian Live](http://live.debian.net) with the help of the script "build-bct\_live-iso".

Procedures and howtos will come later.
